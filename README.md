# NanoTech Signal Analysis Framework

## Overview

NanoTech is a cutting-edge signal analysis platform designed for real-time monitoring and diagnostics at the nanoscale level. This platform integrates advanced AI models, state-of-the-art databases, and secure communication protocols to drive innovations in nanotechnology and diagnostics.

The system is **DARPA-compliant** and built for military-grade security and performance, ensuring robust functionality across diverse environments, including CBRN contexts.

## Key Features
- **EDA Framework:** Powered by Kafka and RabbitMQ for efficient data stream processing.
- **AI Engine:** Utilizes OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton for high-performance AI-powered signal analysis.
- **Secure Communication:** Implements gRPC with Protobuf and Quiche/HTTP3 for low-latency, encrypted data transmission.
- **Databases:**
  - InfluxDB for time-series data.
  - Cloudflare D1/PostgreSQL for transactional storage.
  - Immutable storage via immudb with IPFS archival.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Ensured by Cloudflare Zero Trust and quantum-safe encryption (QKD + PQC).
- **Edge Computing:** Cloudflare Workers for edge-based data processing.
- **Standards Compliance:** ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, and military-grade security.

## System Architecture
NanoTech follows a modular architecture:
1. **Data Ingestion:** High-speed ingestion with Kafka and RabbitMQ.
2. **AI Processing:** Inference models optimized via NVIDIA Triton and ONNX.
3. **Data Storage:** Redundant, decentralized storage through IPFS.
4. **Secure Communication:** End-to-end encryption and quantum resilience.
5. **Real-Time Visualization:** Centralized dashboards for monitoring.
